HAT Power Board Installation Instructions

Install the HAT Board

1) Shutdown your Raspi and remove the USB power connector. 
2) Attach the HAT Power Board to the 40 pin connector.
3) It is recommended that you install plastic standoff and screws into the four corners of the HAT/Raspberry Pi boards.

Attach Battery and Power to the HAT board

With the HAT oriented with the 40 pin connector on top, there are two white connectors on the right side.  
1) Plug the USB interconnect cable into the bottom one, and the battery into the top one.  
2) Plug your USB adapter into the USB interconnect cable (optional, at least until the battery dies.)

Power UP:

Push the red button once.  Your raspi should reboot.

Install the python/shell startup scripts that control the board.
git clone https://github.com/redoakcanyon/HATPowerPython.git
cd HATPowerPython
sudo install.sh

reboot

push the red button now, and the system should issue a "shutting down now" message and in a few seconds, the power should turn off.
push the red button again and it should turn on.

There is a fail-safe power off feature in case the raspi has crashed.  
Normally, when the power is on and you push the button, the Raspi will shut off the power.  
It can't do this if it has crashed.  In this case, you can push the button a second time and it will kill the power.  
Hopefully you won't need to do this as this isn't a safe shutdown.

You can see if power is applied to the HAT board and see if the battery is charging with:

sudo python chargeStatus.py

The power monitor daemon will update /var/battery/level with the currently remaining % battery left. 
When the % gets to 0, the system will automatically and cleanly shut down. 

If you want some other process to monitor the battery level, be careful about reading this file. 
Sometimes there are timing issues with the concurrent read/write file accesses.
